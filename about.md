# About
# About Me

I like to think of myself as an **explorer of visual art forms**. My journey so far has been both satisfying and enriching, as I have had opportunities galore to explore **graphic design, illustration, animation, music, editing, special effects**, and, most importantly, do **research on application of animation for the educational domain**.

---

### 🎓 From Design to Animation

My journey started off with formal training in design. I specialized in **illustration for advertising**. I promptly joined an advertising agency — but left it just as promptly — to follow my passion for **animation**.

I was very fortunate to have **Russian animation experts** guide me into the world of animation. In just three years, these masters revolutionized my understanding of:

- Motion and movement  
- Postures and expressions  
- Body language  
- Finer aspects of non-verbal communication

### 🎬 Entering the World of Feature Films

After the completion of formal training, I got an exciting opportunity to be part of **India’s first full-length animation-live-action feature film**.

Over the next four years, my exposure to:

- **Digital animation**
- **Special effects**
- **Film editing**
- **Feature film production**

...peaked beyond my wildest imagination.

### 💡 Transition to Educational Content

Completing this project left me with a probing question:

> *What should the nature of educational content be to make it as engaging as general entertainment?*

In pursuit of this question, I landed at **IIT Bombay**, India’s premier technology institute.

Initially, the work here seemed quite removed from animation. It was more technical and mundane:

- **Video capture**
- **Editing**
- **Wide-area transmission of educational content**

I took this up as a challenge and successfully created:

- Processes and methodologies
- FAQ sheets
- High-quality standards for content creation

This was the first time I was motivated to **present knowledge in a form that would benefit others**. Pleasing outcomes included:

- 🎓 My **first research paper** published in an international conference (ICDE, 2005)
- 🍏 Acknowledgement from **Apple Asia** as an *Apple Distinguished Educator* (2007)

This experience birthed the **researcher in me** — my true calling.

### 🔁 Back to Animation with a Purpose

After setting up the video capture infrastructure at IIT Bombay, I returned to my passion: **animation**.

A new project called **OSCAR** (Open Source Courseware Animations Repository) awaited me. It was focused on the **education domain**, and I felt destiny had come knocking.

It was during OSCAR that I discovered what would eventually become my **PhD research topic**:

> *Visual communication issues in educational content creation processes.*

---

### 🧠 Research Contributions

For Project OSCAR, I:

- Conceptualized **interaction design strategies** for Learning Objects (LOs)
- Studied the **end-to-end creation process** of LOs
- Identified **communication gaps** between scriptwriters and animators
- Applied principles from:
  - Visual design
  - Video production
  - Animation filmmaking

I improved **design templates** to better align instructional content with animation. The results were **encouraging and published** in:

- EdMedia
- ICCE
- ICEL
- *New Frontiers in Education*

### 🛠 Blender & Community Outreach

At the same time, I discovered **Blender** — a versatile, open-source 3D animation suite. Seeing its potential:

- 🏛 I received a **government grant** from MHRD to popularize Blender
- 👥 Formed **Team Blender**
- 📚 Created training material
- 🇮🇳 Conducted **20 workshops across India**
- 👨‍🎓 Trained **1,000+ learners**  

The response was **overwhelming** — many young engineers took to Blender *like ducks to water*.

---

### 🎓 PhD and Beyond

It was Project OSCAR that led me to **enroll as a research scholar at YCMOU**, a national-level open university in India.

I was fortunate to be mentored by two stalwarts in the **Educational Technology (EdTech)** domain:

- Prof. **Sridhar Iyer**
- Prof. **Sahana Murthy**  
(*Both from IIT Bombay’s interdisciplinary EdTech program*)

Under their guidance, I have been able to steer my research in an **interdisciplinary and eclectic manner**.
