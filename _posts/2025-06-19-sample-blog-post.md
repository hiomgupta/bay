## 🚗 Road Trip 2025: 1st Halt – Nashik

The plan for this year’s vacation road trip was to travel up to **Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra** (my hometown) and return. But this time, we took a different route — instead of the Mumbai-Pune highway, we decided to reach via **Nashik**, owing to an official assignment: a **workshop at YCMOU, Nashik**.

This year’s travelogue will be a **photoblog**, with pictures and a few stories around them.

### 🛣 Stop 1: Baroda

Our first stop was **Baroda**, where the beautifully designed restaurant **Jassi De Parathe** is a favourite of ours. We planned an early lunch to avoid the typical crowd. As always, the food didn’t disappoint!

We savoured:

- **Kachori**
- **Amritsari Parathas**
- And, of course, the **Golgappa Chat** – an essential treat!

### 🏨 Overnight Halt: Shiv Shakti Hotel, Navsari Highway

We drove toward **Navsari**, aiming to cover maximum distance before sunset. We found a clean and reasonably priced **Shiv Shakti Hotel** on the highway, with:

- Air-conditioned rooms  
- Friendly staff and owner

While the **restaurant food was average**, it was acceptable after a hearty lunch. Here's a quick snap that reflects a typical mid-range eatery.

> 🍽 *The “Hara Bhara Kabab” we ordered turned out to be “Kala Neela Kabab” — thanks to multiple frying cycles! Still, once cut open, the bright parrot-green interior revealed hints of added food color.*

### 🚍 Nostalgia in a Parking Lot

After dinner, we took a stroll in the hotel’s large parking lot and saw several **luxury buses** halted for dinner breaks. It brought back memories from:

- **Student days**
- **Early married life**
- **Last-minute bus travels**

#### 🚌 Flashback: Our Luxury Bus Experiences

Kaumudi and I laughed remembering these quirks:

- The "shock absorbers" were a **myth** — it felt like riding a trampoline all night!
- Air conditioners either **froze you** or **didn’t work at all**.
- "In-bus movies" were more of a **torture**:
  - Loud speakers above your head  
  - Repetitive, melodramatic films  
  - VHS tapes with fuzzy audio-video  
- Unpredictable ticket pricing  
- Random, **unclean stops** for bathroom breaks

> 🎧 Today’s buses have better suspension, digital ticketing, and (sometimes) Wi-Fi — but nostalgia hits hard!

### 🌿 Day 2: Navsari to Nashik via Dharampur

We resumed our journey via **Dharampur**, a less busy route. Although the road lacked a divider in most parts, the **scenic beauty** of villages and farmlands made up for it.

### 🏫 At YCMOU, Nashik

The **YCMOU campus** was lush after a few showers. The **Krishi Vigyan Kendra** farms were well maintained and made for a beautiful walk. We also visited the **Gangapur Dam**, located adjacent to the campus.

#### 🧑‍🏫 The Workshop

I conducted a **2-day workshop** for **70 teachers from across Maharashtra** on:

- Script writing  
- Slide designing  
- Creating effective e-learning videos

---

### 🎨 Early Morning Walks & Paintings

We also explored the campus during morning walks. A few landscape sketches and paintings were part of this relaxed routine:

- I completed **two small paintings**
- Kaumudi painted:
  - A scene from the campus  
  - A nearby temple

---

### 👥 A Personal Reunion

After the workshop, I met my old friend **Prasanna Kulkarni** — a colleague from **Raviraj Advertising (1992)**. I left for Market Missionaries, and he joined the **Security Press in Nashik**.

We kept in touch over:

- Letters  
- Messages  
- WhatsApp  
- ...and my blog!

> 📞 This time, I called him and he insisted we meet. It was **heartwarming to reconnect in person after 30+ years.**
